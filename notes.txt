All strips EXACTLY 30 leds on same DATA line
Most likely no more than one full strip active at a time
    - One plug will sufficiently power 4 strips


Background task fading all LEDs (only active ones?) so effects only have to calculate ON and COLOR



Effects:
    - All strips react in sync as an 'audio meter'. USE GRADIENTS
    - Light moves up from bottom and bursts out to other strip 'fireworks'
    - Light moves out and in along strips, mirrored on opposite side and changing direction
    - Spiral from inside out
